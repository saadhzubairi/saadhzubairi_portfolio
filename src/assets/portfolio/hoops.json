        "Hoops is an anonymous social media platform focused on meaningful connections through letter-writing. Unlike traditional apps, users interact without profile pictures, eliminating biases and encouraging depth.",
        "Users can discover friends based on shared interests and Myers-Briggs personality compatibility. Each letter must be at least 600 characters, nudging users toward thoughtful communication. Avatars are randomized and customizable.",
        "It supports adding class schedules and selecting interests to better match users and encourage real-world coordination — all while maintaining anonymity."
