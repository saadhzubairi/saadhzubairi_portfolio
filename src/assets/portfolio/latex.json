      "Designed and implemented JavaFX-based desktop interface for LaTeX generation",

    "about": [
      "LaTeX Lite is a beginner-friendly desktop app designed to help users generate LaTeX documents without prior exposure to LaTeX syntax. It enables structured document building through intuitive inputs and real-time previewing.",
      "The app offers configurable document types, paragraph/section creation, list builders, code formatters, and path inserters â€” all wrapped in a JavaFX UI with live preview. It significantly reduces the learning curve for new LaTeX users.",
      "Upon finalizing the content, users can export the generated LaTeX code, paste it into any LaTeX compiler (like MiKTeX), and get perfectly formatted documents consistent with the preview."
