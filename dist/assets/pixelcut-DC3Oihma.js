With simple controls and easy to navigate levels (but not enough to stop the steam rolling on the temples).",p="In my quest to delve into 2D platformer games, I undertook the challenge of creating Pixel Cut, a visually appealing and enjoyable game with vibrant graphics and amusing sound effects. I utilized Pixel Adventure Assets from the Unity store, along with sound effects from the same source. My journey began with a YouTube tutorial that guided me through the creation of a very simple first level. Inspired, I expanded the game by designing additional levels, each featuring intricate traps and obstacles. Pixel Cut is the most comprehensive game I’ve made to date.",u="/Projects/pixelcut/techImg.png",d="Unity 2D",g="The game was developed using Unity 2D with it’s simple and intuitive scripting and drag-and-drop based UI with easy to use component mapping and asset management.",h="<p>The code structure is straightforward, featuring key elements such as prefabs for reusable game objects. These prefabs include Burners, Moving Platforms, Players, Fans, Saws, Finishes, Spike Rocks, the Main Camera, and Melons.</p><p><br></p><p>Scenes, representing different game levels, are organized in the 'Scenes' directory. </p><p><br></p><p>All scripts are conveniently located in the './Scripts' directory.
